Commit messages must follow this structure: [TAG] module: Change message T#00000. TAG is the type of change (e.g., FIX, ADD, IMP). module is the name of the module where the change is applied. Change message is a self-explanatory description of the change. Avoid vague messages like 'bug fix' or 'improvements'. T#00000 is the optional task number for traceability.
