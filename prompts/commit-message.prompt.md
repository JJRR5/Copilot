Commit messages must follow this structure: [TAG] module: Change message T#00000. TAG is the type of change (e.g., FIX, ADD, IMP). module is the name of the module where the change is applied. Change message is a self-explanatory description of the change. Avoid vague messages like 'bug fix' or 'improvements'. T#00000 is the optional task number for traceability.

For the commit's body, provide a detailed explanation of the change, including the reasoning behind it, any relevant context, and potential impacts on other parts of the codebase. Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity when necessary, use no more than 100 words.
